A **dynamic programming language** is a programming language in which operations otherwise done at compile-time can be done at run-time. For example, in JavaScript it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.

This is opposed to so-called static programming languages, in which such changes are normally not possible.

> **참고:** Note that while there is indeed a connection between this dynamic/static property of programming languages and [dynamic](/ko/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing)/[static-typing](/ko/docs/Glossary/Static_typing), the two are far from synonymous.
